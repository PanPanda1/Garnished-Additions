Garnished Additions is an addon mod to Create Garnished that, by version 1.0.0, will add over 100 new edible foods and a host of other items to the game!
<br>
This mod also absorbs my previous project, Garnished Botany Pots, as I saw no reason to keep both maintained separately when GBP fits within this mod in theme and function

This Github should eventually act as a full guide through the mod's items and recipes. If I have missed anything/written anything incorrect, if you want to get sneak peaks on future updates, or just join the community and suggest new features and items, you can join the discord here.
